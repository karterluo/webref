### uploading images
- paste image from clipboard (if user cannot save images for uploading)
- paste link
- upload image normally
### saving, importing, and exporting
- auto-save to browser storage
- zip + export archive of images + JSON/text of dimensions/positions
- import archive
### features
- pan, zoom
- move, resize images
- optimal auto-arrange images

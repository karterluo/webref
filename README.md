## idea

Browser-based reference board (like PureRef) for people who don't want to or can't install apps (e.g. Chromebooks/managed computers/personal preference).

## canvas

- [ ] UI cleanup
- [ ] arrange images optimally
- [ ] pan and zoom canvas
- [x] add image by uploading file
- [x] delete image
- [x] move and resize images
- [x] context menu
- [x] add image by pasting
- [x] delete and paste using keyboard

## saving, importing, exporting

- [ ] export archive (zip: images, JSON)
- [ ] import archive
- [ ] auto-save to IndexedDB - could I just save the entire refMap???
